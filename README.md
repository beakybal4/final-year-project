# Level Crossing Predictor

## State of the code
THIS IS POC CODE

I basically took some old code I had when I reversed the National Rail API

## Description

###Level Crossing Predictor

Difficulty: flexible.

Requirements: programming skills

Group size: 2-5

Level crossing closures are a cause of delay, have a negative impact on the environment due to fumes of stopped transport, and prevent vital emergency services from getting to their destination quickly. The problem is particularly noticeable in Canterbury, which has level crossings on main transport routes.

Can level crossing closures be predicted? Rail timetables plus real time train feeds might make journey planning through level crossings more reliable. Redirecting via longer, but quicker routes or delaying journeys would then be possible.

This project is to develop such a level crossing predictor, integrate with suitable mapping software on the web and/or mobile apps. Field testing for accuracy would be a key part of the final stages of the project.
