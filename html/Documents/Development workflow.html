<h3 id="1-branch-from-master">1. Branch from Master</h3>
<p>All new features are created in a new branch created from master following the format of <code>feature/{feature name}</code>. All coding and testing will done in here.</p>
<h3 id="2-pull-request-to-master">2. Pull request to master</h3>
<p>Once the feature is ready to go into the main branch. A pull request will be made from the feature branch into the main branch. It will then be reviewed and tested before merging. </p>
<p><strong>All pull requests must be auto-mergable.</strong></p>
<h3 id="3-travis-validates-merge">3. Travis validates merge</h3>
<p>When a pull request is made, this will automatically trigger a request to travis which will run the automated tests against the auto-merged code.</p>
<h3 id="4-merge-into-master">4. Merge into master</h3>
<p>Once a merge has passed all tests and code has been reviewed by a second member of the team, then the branch will be merged into master.</p>
<h3 id="5-auto-deployment">5. Auto deployment</h3>
<p>Finally when the merge is committed to the master branch the development server will automatically pull the lasted version of the code for demonstration.</p>
