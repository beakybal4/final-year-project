<p>The interface is responsive so it scales to all screen sizes. Due to the simplicty of the design, the layout itself doesn’t need to change as it scales.</p>
<h2 id="interface-testing">Interface testing</h2>
<p>After building a mock of the user interface it was tested on a small group of people for usability as well as private testing with different data sets. 
As a result of the testing 3 changes were made:</p>
<ul>
<li>Search bar was removed - Due to the limited area of coverage, no one ever attempted to use this.</li>
<li>More information bubble was made a model - This provided more room to display data, as the popup provided little space, this was particularly an issue on smaller devices.</li>
<li>The “Go to my current location” button was removed as Google maps does not allow this with their API.</li>
</ul>
<p>The UI is now overall slightly simplier which is possible as we went for a map based view which the user can also navigate manually.</p>
