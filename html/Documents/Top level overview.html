<h2 id="data-sources">Data Sources</h2>
<p>The project uses 3 data sources:</p>
<ul>
<li>National Rail: provides the live train location data. This is then stored persistantly to predict where the train will be in the future.</li>
<li>National Rail: provides the locations of rail lines and stations.</li>
<li>Network Rail: provides the locations, photos, and other attributes of the level crossings.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="system">System</h2>
<p>The clever part of the system has two key systems, with other background processes which help move data around.</p>
<ul>
<li>Storage: Data will be pulled in from the remote data sources and stored forever</li>
<li>Analysis engine: This will use the up to date and historial data in the storage to predict  what the current status of level crossings are now, and times for the future.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="users">Users</h2>
<p>There are 2 primary users of the system.</p>
<ul>
<li>Human Users: Users who accesses the site through a web app which works on desktops, tablets, and smartphones.</li>
<li>3rd Party Systems: who are able to access the raw data from an open, RESTful API.</li>
</ul>
